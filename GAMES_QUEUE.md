# Game Factory — Queue & Status

On-disk state for the autonomous game-integration loop (the "factory"). The
universe map and capability gaps live in `GAME_BACKLOG.md`; this file is the
*queue* and the *human-escalation digest*.

## The gate (option 1, updated 2026-06-21)

Erik delegated merge authority: the orchestrator may auto-merge after a **detailed
independent code review**, without separate approval.

- **AUTO-MERGE to `main`** — `agp validate` green **AND** the rules are confirmed
  faithful by an *independent* check: a published numeric anchor (chess-family
  **perft** / solved result) **OR** a clean adversarial rule-review (a fresh agent
  re-deriving every move + win condition with no faults) **plus the orchestrator's
  own code review**. A published anchor is preferred but no longer required.
- **QUEUE for review** — only when the review surfaces a genuine **open ruleset
  decision** that's Erik's to make, a **new board shape/rendering** needing his
  eyes, or an issue that can't be confidently auto-resolved. Held on a `factory/*`
  branch + listed under *Needs human*.
- **BLOCKED** — needs a missing platform primitive (stacking, hand/drops, Go
  territory scoring, point-and-line edges, >2-seat UI). Deferred; see
  `GAME_BACKLOG.md`.

The loop: discover → implement (isolated, reference an existing package) →
`agp validate` + anchor self-test → **independent** adversarial rule-review →
deterministic gate → auto-merge or queue. Verifier is a *different* agent than the
implementer.

## Batch 1 — harness proof (2026-06-20)
| Game | Lane | Anchor | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| King of the Hill | auto | chess perft 20/400/8902 (re-derived) + center-king win | **done(auto) → main** |
| Three-Check | auto | chess perft 20/400/8902 (re-derived) + 3-check win | **done(auto) → main** |
| Tablut (9×9 tafl) | review | conformance + capture/escape positions; no published number | **done → main** (king-assist resolved from Cyningstan) |

Both auto games were independently re-verified (the verifier recomputed perft to
197281 at depth 4, matching standard chess) and re-checked by me before merge. The
factory's per-package `selftest.py` is run by the suite via `test_package_selftests`.

## Batch 2 — chess-variant pack (2026-06-20)
| Game | Lane | Anchor | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Racing Kings | auto | shakmaty perft 21/421/11264 + 31,920 python-chess differential positions, 0 mismatches | **done(auto) → main** |
| Makruk (Thai chess) | review→auto | independent adversarial review (option 1) | **done → main** |
| Shatranj (medieval) | review→auto | independent adversarial review (option 1) | **done → main** |
| Capablanca (10×8) | review→auto | independent adversarial review (option 1) | **done → main** |

Under the option-1 gate, all three merged after a detailed independent review:
three fresh adversarial code reviewers (separate from the factory's verifiers),
each returning MERGE with no required fixes, plus the orchestrator's own code read
and runtime probes of the risk areas (Makruk 6th-rank promotion, Shatranj Alfil
leap / bare-king, Capablanca castling).
